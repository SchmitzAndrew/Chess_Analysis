This program hopes to answer at what time during the day I am the best at playing chess.

My hopethesis is that I am better during the afternoon rather than the morning or night since this is when I have the greatest mental performance.

To improve my results, I could bootstrap my current data or use other player's data to determine if my hyptohesis is true for others.
